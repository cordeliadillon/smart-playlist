node-spotify install steps (OSX)
--------------------------------
1. Install node.js
2. Install homebrew (http://brew.sh/).
3. Make homebrew happy (Do "brew doctor") if it has any serious problems with your environment. I had a lot of warnings and it was fine, though.
4. Do "brew install libspotify"
5. In the spotify module directory, do "npm install"
